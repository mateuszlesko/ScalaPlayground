# Scala Playground
## About
My knowledge gained from books or stackoverflow forum is contained here.

I am using Scala in version 3

### Some worlds about Scala:
Scala is general purpose languge working around JVM. The Scala's code is easily maintable. It's designed to handle both programming paradigms; Object Oriented Programming and Functional Oriented Programming. In Scale we don't have to stick to particular style, but we can take adavtages of one or the other paradigm depended

In Scala every value is an object and also every function in an value..

#### How works with JVM?
The Scala's compiler (scalac) translate source code to bytecode (*.class). Thanks to JVM Scala can run Java's code and even use Java' libraries.

### Usage
#### SBT = SCALA BUILD TOOL
It's the most common build tool used by community.
 You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

#### sbt requirments:
Some jdk installed on your machine
